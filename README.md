naplib
======
These collection of utilities are used to augment the VESPER project (http://www.github.com/martingraham/vesper.git)

However, most of the functions are general purpose enough to be reused somewhere else, so I've split them off

Libraries
---------
The library performs changes to some D3 functions and uses JQuery in parts, so they've been added as dependencies
